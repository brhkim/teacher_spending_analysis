# teacher_spending_analysis
Replication code to conduct teacher out-of-pocket spending analysis in the report "Supporting Students at Any Cost? Examining the Dynamics of Teacher Out-of-Pocket Spending, Student Demographics, and Teacher Autonomy." Note that this codebase requires the restricted-use data from NCES for the Schools and Staffing Survey waves in 2007-2008 and 2011-2012. Please let me know if you have any concerns, suggestions, or questions!
